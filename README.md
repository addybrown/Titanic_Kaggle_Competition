# Titanic_Kaggle_Competition
Titanic Kaggle Competition, gets a score of 0.7945% should easily with a bit of tweeking to improve upon that score


Titanic Kaggle Challenge Project: Score 0.7924

Since doing this project I have learned a lot more about Machine Learning and AI, and plan to do an update:

1) add hyper-parameter tuning
2) there is a bit of overfitting so can potentially do L1 regularization to correct for this (not sure how effective this will be) 
3) do better modelling of age as a prediction 


I have recently learned more about tensorflow and keras and how to use them effectively for hyper parameter tuning
